>Now you know the second principle of Redux -- the state is read only. The only way to change the state tree is by dispatching an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object, describing in the minimal way what changed in the application. Whether it is initiated by a network request or by user interaction, any data that gets into the Redux application gets there by actions.

>Redux的第二个原则：state是只读的。唯一改变state的方式就是通过dispatch一个action，一个action是一个简单的JavaScript对象，这个对象最详细的描述着应用中发生着哪些改变。无论是网络请求，还是用户交互，任何进入Redux应用的数据都需要action才能到达state。
